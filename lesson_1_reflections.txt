How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed the differences between the files, and ignored everything else.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I would not be afraid of deleting code (because I can go back)
Also, it would be easy to copy and paste from the past!


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

it's great because I won't have trash commits,
on the other hand, I might forget to commit


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because some projects require multiple files as dependencies, so it's way easier


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
observe the change long, and then drill down on specifics

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
IT MAKES IT EASY TO GO BACK


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
to build knocknock of course
